        <h1 id="title">Hospital Occupancy Data from ECDC</h1>
        <p>The below chart shows hospital occupancy over time <span class="altFont">(</span><b>NOT</b> daily hospitalizations<span class="altFont">) </span>for the countries for which data have been provided by the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-data-hospital-and-icu-admission-rates-and-current-occupancy-covid-19">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control</a>.  &nbsp; Also note that this is a record of hospitalized patients for whom testing for covid 19 was positive, not of patients who were hospitalized directly because of covid 19.  This graph also does not indicate occupancy as a percentage of total available beds.  &nbsp; From what I could determine, it is actually fairly typical for rates to be above 90% <span class="altFont">(</span>or even exceed total available<span class="altFont">)</span> during some seasons <span class="altFont">(</span><a href="https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_542-6210-bed-occupancy-rate-acute-care-hospitals-only/">occupancy rate by year </a>for some European regions<span class="altFont">)</span></p> 
        <p>Data are used in line with ECDCâ€™s <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/copyright">copyright policy</a>.</p>
        <p>Countries are visualized by color and include: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom 
        </p>
        <p>Some countries include both hospital and specifically ICU occupancy, which is why they have multiple peaks.  Data points have tooltip info on the desktop view.</p>
